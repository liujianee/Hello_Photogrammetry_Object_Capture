# Hello_Photogrammetry_Object_Capture
In this repo I'd like to share some of my trial in using Apple's [Object Capture API](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/object-capture/). The repo mainly includes the raw data and the reconstructed objects, plus a Blender project where I composited a lovely scene using all the captured outputs.
